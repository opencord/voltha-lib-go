      "message": "Since these changes are in the library then a preferred fix would be to have a context passed in as a parameter.  This way a caller can set it\u0027s own timeout and if the context is nil then we can have a default timeout here.   Can you check how much work it would take to add a context parameter to all the KV client interface?  Thanks.",

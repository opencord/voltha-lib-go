      "message": "It seems we should not. Suppose that the multicast gem port id is 2, the gem port id pool starts with 1 and there are two clients; the first one is using HSI and VoIP services, the second one is just using multicast service. When we provision the first subscriber, gem port id 1 will be allocated for HSI and 2 will be allocated for VoIP respectively. When we provision the second subscriber, we cannot reserve multicast gem port id 2 since it has already been used by the first client\u0027s VoIP service. That is why we should reserved gem port ids during pool creation.",

      "message": "According to my approach, reserved gem ports shall be written under the ponresourcemanager\u0027s path on kv store. The exact path is as follows.\n\n\nservice/voltha/resource_manager/{%technology%}/reserved_gemport_ids\n\n\nMy only concern in my approach is that the configuration path should not contain any variable (I mean %technology%). It should look like the following because it is just a configuration and regardless of underlined technology. However, ponresourcemanager\u0027s kvclient can only read from the path above. To make ponresourcemanager to read from the below path, I need to create a new kvclient and it means a new connection for just reading config data. I could not sure whether it is worthy or not.\n\n\nservice/voltha/resource_manager/config/reserved_gemport_ids",

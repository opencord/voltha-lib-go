      "message": "It seems we should not. Suppose that the multicast gem port id is 2, the gem port id pool starts with 1 and there are two clients; the first one is using HSI and VoIP services, the second one is just using multicast service. When we provision the first subscriber, gem port id 1 will be allocated for HSI and 2 will be allocated for VoIP respectively. When we provision the second subscriber, we cannot reserve multicast gem port id 2 since it has already been used by the first client\u0027s VoIP service. That is why we should reserved gem port ids during pool creation.",

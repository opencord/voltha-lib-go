      "message": "Excellent question\n\nI can think of two cases that might explain it:\n  o Stray file checkin (% git add --all)\n  o More likely -- editor settings, someone wanted to avoid having re-configuring their environment whenever the repository is cloned.\n\nThough thinking about that last item more, adding .vscode/ would be akin to distributing personal preference to the project as a default w/o discussion.\n\nIt creates a form of variant behavior, not all Broadband/VOLTHA repositories are configured with a .vscode/ directory.\n\nOh and launch.json also contains a version string (\"version\": \"0.2.0\").\nWondering if that might inadvertently freeze something in the local development environment unless the file is actively maintained and checked in.\n\nNOTE: File added/last updated 2021\n\nIn hindsight I would vote to remove the vscode directory, [any thoughts] ?\n\nIf configs and maintenance are not standard but needed for convenience it could be supported by two answers:\n   o Edit .gitignore to prevent checkins.\n   o For individual use and preferences:\n      - Create a shell script to archive/restore vscode between checkouts.\n   o If .vscode/ has a larger audience:\n      - Create a git repository for storing a portable base config (and versions!)\n      - Add the vscode repo as a git submodule so devs will have a familiar base to work with.\n\n[any thoughts] ?",

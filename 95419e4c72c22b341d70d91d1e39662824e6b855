      "message": "could this be just `sc.updateLiveness(sc.isLivenessError(notOk))`? it may mean setting True and the value is already True, but that should sort of be short circuited in the `updateLiveness` function i would think.",

      "message": "That\u0027s what I had originally written, and then I changed it to this. My concern was that we would erroneously set it to True. Consider for example if liveness is set False due to a connectivity error, then some other \"unimportant\" or unanticipated error comes along, we wouldn\u0027t want that to toggle the state back to live.",

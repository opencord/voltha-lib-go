      "message": "For partition consumer it is expected for the client to retry In this scenario kafka itself may have become healthy.  It may be ok for now to set it as unhealthy as we are using mostly group consumers and if anywhere partition consumer is used (not the core) I am pretty sure there are no retry in that code.",

David and I discussed this briefly a couple weeks ago and concluded this it\u0027s sufficiently rare occurrence that restarting the adapter would not be overly burdensome.\n(Note that this doesn\u0027t happen on a network partition or other temporary connectivity issue; it\u0027s when kafka is scaled down and then scaled back up that the sarama library realizes it\u0027s talking to a new Kafka instance and closes the consumer)",

      "message": "I have got a doubt on this approach. For each liveness state pushed to channel and processed by rw_core, processing is performed to update probe status and then timeout is re-calculated thus causing reset of Timer in case statement.\n\nI guess, in a typical vOLTHA deployment serving some OLTs, this constant flood of liveness state would consume more CPU cycle than probably performing One forced liveness check after every 60 seconds (Live Probe Interval)",

      "message": "The probe status update ends up a no-op if the probe status hasn\u0027t changed, whereas producing a forced liveness message is going to lead to processing across multiple components and consumption of resources for the message itself. Let\u0027s take this discussion up in the voltha-stabilization group and get some opinions. I\u0027m not opposed to your suggestions, I can see advantages and disadvantages either way.",
